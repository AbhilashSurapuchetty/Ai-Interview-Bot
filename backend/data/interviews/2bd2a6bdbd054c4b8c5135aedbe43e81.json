  "questions": [
    "1. Let's say you're building a classification model and notice high variance. Describe three different strategies you could employ to address this, and discuss the potential trade-offs of each approach.",
    "2. Explain the concept of \"vanishing gradients\" in the context of deep neural networks. What causes them, and what are some techniques you can use to mitigate them?",
    "3. Imagine you have a dataset with both numerical and categorical features. Describe how you would preprocess and prepare this data for use in a machine learning model. Explain your choice of encoding methods for the categorical variables.",
    "4. You're tasked with evaluating the performance of a model that predicts whether a customer will churn. Explain which evaluation metrics are most relevant in this scenario, and why. Consider the potential costs associated with false positives and false negatives.",
    "5. Describe a time when you encountered a significant challenge during a machine learning project. What was the challenge, what steps did you take to address it, and what was the outcome?"
